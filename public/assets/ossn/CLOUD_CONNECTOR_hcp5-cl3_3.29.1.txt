      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      1. Definitions.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
      granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including
      but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
      files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
      translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
      generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
      available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
      in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
      based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
      original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
      shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
      name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
      of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
      thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
      the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
      behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
      Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
      electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
      that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
      and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
      or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
      Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
      whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
      within the Work.
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
      form.
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
      license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
      transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
      licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
      which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
      You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed.
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
      Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
          this License; and
        b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and
        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
          distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
          any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
          attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
          one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
          the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
          along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
          not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
          Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
          NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
          cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

      The GNU General Public License (GPL)
      ====================================
      Version 2, June 1991
      --------------------
      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      Preamble
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
      and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
      guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
      software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
      of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
      commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
      the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
      programs, too.
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
      General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
      distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
      that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
      the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
      do these things.
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
      you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
      translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
      software, or if you modify it.
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
      fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
      sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
      these terms so they know their rights.
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
      you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
      modify the software.
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
      software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
      know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
      to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
      obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
      this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
      use or not licensed at all.
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
      follow.
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
      placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
      this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
      work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
      derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
      Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
      translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
      limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
      this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
      restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
      constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
      running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
      you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
      publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
      keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
      warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
      along with the Program.
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
      your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
      forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
      or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
      these conditions:
            a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change.
            b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
            in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
            licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
            this License.
            c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
            you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
            most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
            appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
            else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
            the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
            of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
            not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
            not required to print an announcement.)
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
      considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
      its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
      works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
      work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
      and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights
      to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
      control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
      Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
      distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
      License.
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
      2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      provided that you also do one of the following:
            a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
            code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
            on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
            b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
            give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
            performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
            corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
            and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
            c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
            distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
            noncommercial distribution
      and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
      modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
      source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
      files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
      executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
      include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
      with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
      on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
      executable.
      If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
      from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
      parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
      expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
      sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
      your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
      rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
      long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
      However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
      or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
      this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
      based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
      all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
      or works based on it.
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
      recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
      distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may
      not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
      granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
      to this License.
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
      or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
      you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
      conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
      License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
      obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
      consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
      who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
      could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
      distribution of the Program.
      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
      particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
      section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
      other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
      section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
      distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
      people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
      through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
      up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
      through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
      consequence of the rest of this License.
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
      countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
      holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
      distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
      permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
      License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
      spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
      or concerns.
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a
      version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
      have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
      of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
      does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
      ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
      whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
      permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
      write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
      decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
      derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
      software generally.
      NO WARRANTY
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
      PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
      IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
      LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
      PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
      ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
      ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
      PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
      TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
      THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
      PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
      files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
      translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
      generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
      available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
      in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
      based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
      original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
      shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
      name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
      of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works

      or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
      Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
      whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
      within the Work.
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to

      form.
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
      license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise

      licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
      which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
      You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed.
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
      Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
          this License; and
        b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and
        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
          distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
          any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
          attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
          one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
          the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
          along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
          not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
          Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
          NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
          cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
      based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
      original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works

      name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version

      Contribution."

      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to

      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
      You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed.

          this License; and
        b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and
        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You

          any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

          attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
          one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
          the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
          along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
          not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
          Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
          NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
          cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

      2. License Grants and Conditions
      --------------------------------
        2.1. Grants
        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
        license:
          a. 
            under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
            display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
            either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger
            Work; and
          b. 
            under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
            have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
            Contributor Version.
        2.2. Effective Date
        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
        effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
        such Contribution.
        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
        License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
        or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
        Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
          a. 
            for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
          b. 
            for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or
          c. 
            under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
            Contributions.
        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
        logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
        requirements in Section 3.4).
        2.4. Subsequent Licenses
        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
        the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see
        Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
        terms of Section 3.3).
        2.5. Representation
        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
        its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
        Contributions conveyed by this License.
        2.6. Fair Use
        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
        copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
        2.7. Conditions
        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
        Section 2.1.
      3. Responsibilities
      -------------------
        3.1. Distribution of Source Form
        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
        terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
        obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.
        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
          a. 
            such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
            described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
            Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
            means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
            to the recipient; and
          b. 
            You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
            sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
            Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
            in the Source Code Form under this License.
        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
        Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
        a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
        not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
        additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
        License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
        further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
        or such Secondary License(s).
        3.4. Notices
        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
        copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
        liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
        except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
        known factual inaccuracies.
        3.5. Application of Additional Terms
        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
        or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
        However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
        Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
        agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
        Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
        offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
        liability specific to any jurisdiction.
      4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
      ---------------------------------------------------
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
      respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
      regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
      maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
      affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
      distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
      prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
      detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
      5. Termination
      --------------
        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
        fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
        the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
        reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
        finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
        Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
        prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
        grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
        Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
        is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
        receipt of the notice.
        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
        cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
        Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
        terminate.
        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
        license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
        validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
        termination shall survive termination.
      6. Disclaimer of Warranty
      -------------------------
      Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
      warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
      limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
      merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
      to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
      Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
      the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
      warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
      Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
      7. Limitation of Liability
      --------------------------
      Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
      negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
      distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
      indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
      stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
      damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
      of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
      death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
      applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
      exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
      and limitation may not apply to You.
      8. Litigation
      -------------
      Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
      jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
      such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
      to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
      party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
      9. Miscellaneous
      ----------------
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
      hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
      provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
      construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
      a Contributor.
      10. Versions of the License
      ---------------------------
        10.1. New Versions
        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
        no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
        versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
        number.
        10.2. Effect of New Versions
        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
        License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
        terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
        10.3. Modified Versions
        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
        new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
        this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
        the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
        this License).
        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
        described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
      available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
      in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
      based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
      original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
      shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
      name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
      of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
      thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by

      behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
      Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on

      and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
      or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
      Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
      whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
      within the Work.
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
      form.
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
      license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
      transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
      licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
      which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
      You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed.
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
      Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
          this License; and
        b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and
        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
          distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
          any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
          attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
          one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
          the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
          along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
          not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
          Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
          NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
          cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      Version 2.0, January 2004
      =========================
      http://www.apache.org/licenses/
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
      1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
      distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
      owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities
      that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.
      For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
      indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
      contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
      granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including
      but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration
      files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
      translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
      generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
      available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
      in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
      based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
      original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
      shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
      name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
      of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
      thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
      the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
      behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
      Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
      electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
      that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
      and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
      or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
      Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
      whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
      within the Work.
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
      form.
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
      license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
      transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
      licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
      which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
      You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed.
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
      Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
          this License; and
        b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and
        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
          distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
          any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
          attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
          one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
          the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
          along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
          not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
          Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
          NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
          cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work

      Version 2, June 1991
      --------------------
      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
      Preamble
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
      and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
      guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
      software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
      of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
      commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
      the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
      programs, too.
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
      General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
      distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
      that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
      the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
      do these things.
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
      you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
      translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
      software, or if you modify it.
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
      fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
      sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
      these terms so they know their rights.
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
      you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
      modify the software.
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
      software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
      know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
      to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
      obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
      this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
      use or not licensed at all.
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
      follow.
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
        1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
          placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
          of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
          program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
          or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
          the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
          translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
          without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
          "you".
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
          by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
          is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
          contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
          made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
          Program does.
        2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
          you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
          appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
          disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
          License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
          the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
          You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
          at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
        3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
          forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
          modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
          also meet all of these conditions:
            a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
              that you changed the files and the date of any change.
            b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
              in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
              be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
              of this License.
            c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
              you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
              most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
              appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
              else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
              the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
              copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
              but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
              Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
          sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
          considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
          and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
          separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
          which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
          on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
          the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
          rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
          right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
          the Program.
          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
          the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
          distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
          License.
        4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
          Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
          and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
            a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
              code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
              on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
            b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
              give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
              performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
              corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
              1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
            c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
              distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
              for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
              object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
              Subsection b above.)
          The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
          modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
          the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
          definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
          installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
          code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
          either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
          and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
          component itself accompanies the executable.
          If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
          copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
          source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
          even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
          object code.
        5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
          expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
          sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
          terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
          copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
          terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
        6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
          However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
          Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
          do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
          Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
          this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
          distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
        7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
          the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
          copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
          the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
          by third parties to this License.
        8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
          infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
          conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
          otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
          you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
          satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
          pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
          Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
          royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
          directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
          it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
          Program.
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
          particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
          the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
          It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
          or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
          this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
          software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
          practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
          software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
          application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
          she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
          cannot impose that choice.
          This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
          consequence of the rest of this License.
        9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
          countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
          copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
          explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
          that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
          In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
          body of this License.
        10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
          General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
          in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
          problems or concerns.
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
          specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
          version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
          that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
          Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
          you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
          whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
          permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
          Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
          exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
          preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
          promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
          NO WARRANTY
        12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
          THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
          STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
          PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
          INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
          FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
          PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
          YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
          ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
          THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
          GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
          OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
          DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
          A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
          HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
      to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
      everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
      them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
      warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
      to where the full notice is found.
      one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
      as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
      of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
      starts in an interactive mode:
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
      type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome
      to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
      for details.
      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
      of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
      something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
      menu items--whatever suits your program.
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
      if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
      sample; alter the names:
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
      interest in the program `Gnomovision'
      (which makes passes at compilers) written
      by James Hacker.

      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
      proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
      it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
      this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
      of this License.

            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
            [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
            as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
            the version number 2.1.]
      Preamble
      --------
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
      and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
      guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
      software is free for all its users.
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
      designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
      Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
      suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
      General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
      based on the explanations below.
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
      to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
      that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
      the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
      that you can do these things.
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
      deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
      translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
      library or if you modify it.
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
      fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
      sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
      with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
      that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
      and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
      (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
      distribute and/or modify the library.
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
      warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
      and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
      version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by
      problems that might be introduced by others.
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
      program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
      users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
      Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
      library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
      license.
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
      General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
      applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
      General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
      permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
      library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
      derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore
      permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
      The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other
      code with the library.
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
      protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
      provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
      non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
      Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
      advantages in certain special circumstances.
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
      widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.
      To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more
      frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
      libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to
      free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
      enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
      example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
      more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
      GNU/Linux operating system.
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
      freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
      Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
      version of the Library.
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
      follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
      library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
      from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
      to run.
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
      contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
      it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
      called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
      to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
      functions and data) to form executables.
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
      distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
      Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
      containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
      and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
      translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
      modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
      code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
      plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
      this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
      Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
      contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
      Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
      Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
      code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
      appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
      of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
      absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
      Library.
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
      your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
      forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
      or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
      these conditions:
            a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
            b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
            that you changed the files and the date of any change.
            c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
            third parties under the terms of this License.
            d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
            data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
            than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
            a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
            supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
            that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
            Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
            by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
            the square root function must still compute square roots.)
            These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
            sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
            reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
            this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
            distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
            sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
            distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
            permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
            each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
            Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
            rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
            the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
            based on the Library.
            In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
            the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
            or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
            this License.
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
      instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
      alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
      ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
      newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
      appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any
      other change in these notices.
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
      the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
      derivative works made from that copy.
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
      a program that is not a library.
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
      under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
      Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
      the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
      though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
      code.
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
      designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
      a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
      work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
      executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
      the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
      therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
      such executables.
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part
      of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the
      Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
      significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
      itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
      law.
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
      accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
      length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
      it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
      portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
      object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
      that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with
      the Library itself.
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
      that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
      the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
      the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
      engineering for debugging such modifications.
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
      used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must
      supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
      notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
      well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
      must do one of these things:
            a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
            source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
            work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
            work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
            machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
            code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
            modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
            the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
            not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
            definitions.)
            b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
            suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
            already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
            functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
            modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
            modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
            made with.
            c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
            to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for
            a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
            d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
            designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
            materials from the same place.
            e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
            that you have already sent this user a copy.
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
      include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
      it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
      include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
      with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
      on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
      executable.
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
      proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
      contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
      executable that you distribute.
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
      side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
      covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
      the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
      library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
      things:
            a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
            Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
            distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
            b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
            it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
            accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
      except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
      modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
      received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
      licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
      However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
      or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
      this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
      based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
      all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library
      or works based on it.
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
      the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
      copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
      conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
      exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
      compliance by third parties with this License.
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
      or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
      you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
      conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
      License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
      obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
      consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
      who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
      could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
      distribution of the Library.
      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
      particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the
      section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
      other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
      section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
      distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
      have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
      through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
      up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
      through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
      consequence of the rest of this License.
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
      countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
      holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical
      distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
      permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
      License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
      similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
      problems or concerns.
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
      version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
      have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
      of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
      does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
      published by the Free Software Foundation.
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
      whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to
      ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
      Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
      for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
      status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
      reuse of software generally.
      NO WARRANTY
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
      LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
      IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
      LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
      LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
      ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
      ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
      LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
      TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
      THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
      PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
      ----------------------------------------------
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
      to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
      redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
      terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
      License).
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
      to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
      exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
      and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
            one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
            Copyright (C) year name of author
            This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
            modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
            License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
            version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
            This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
            Lesser General Public License for more details.
            You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
            License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
      if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a
      sample; alter the names:
            Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
            the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written
            by James Random Hacker.
            signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990
            Ty Coon, President of Vice
      That's all there is to it!

        1.10.1. "Patent Claims" means any patent claim(s), now owned or hereafter
        acquired, including without limitation,  method, process, and apparatus claims,
        in any patent Licensable by grantor.
        1.11. ''Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for making
        modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated
        interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and
        installation of an Executable, or source code differential comparisons against
        either the Original Code or another well known, available Covered Code of the
        Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form,
        provided the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely
        available for no charge.
        1.12. "You'' (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity exercising
        rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future
        version of this License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities, "You''
        includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common
        control with You. For purposes of this definition, "control'' means (a) the
        power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
        whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent
        (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.
      2. Source Code License.
        2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. The Initial Developer hereby grants You a
        world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
        intellectual property claims:
          (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
          Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
          sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
          without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
          Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale,
          and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).
          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the
          date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of
          this License.
          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)
          for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the
          Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the
          Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software
          or devices.  
        2.2. Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims,
        each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
        license
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
          Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
          sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
          portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
          Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of 
          Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination
          with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use,
          sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)
          Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the
          combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
          Version (or portions of such combination).
          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the
          date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)
          for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)

          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that
          Contributor.
      3. Distribution Obligations.
        3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
        contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
        limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
        distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
        License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
        with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
        any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
        version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
        include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
        Section 3.5.
        3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
        You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
        this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
        accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
        Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
        Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date
        it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
        version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
        recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
        remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
        by a third party.
        3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
        contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
        Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
        that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
        provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
        Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
        version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
        of the Covered Code.
        3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
          third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must
          include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which
          describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that
          a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
          after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
          makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
          appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
          those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
          (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
          programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include
          this information in the LEGAL file.  
                  (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
          above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
          Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
          to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
        3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
        of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
        Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
        location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
        for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
        name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
        duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
        describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You
        may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
        may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
        or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
        support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
        hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
        warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
        3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
        Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
        that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
        version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
        including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
        Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
        Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
        recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
        Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
        choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
        are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
        Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in
        the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
        distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it
        absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
        You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
        indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
        incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
        terms You offer.
        3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
        other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
        Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
        of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
      4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
        with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,
        or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
        maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
        affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
        Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
        Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
        be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
        understand it.
      5. Application of this License.
        This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
        notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
      6. Versions of the License.
        6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may
        publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
        version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
        particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
        terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
        terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
        other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
        Code created under this License.
        6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
        (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
        Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
        that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
        ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
        to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
        clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
        Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the
        Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
        Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
        License.)
      7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
      IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
      MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
      TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
      COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR
      ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
      CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
      LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
      DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION.
        8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
        breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
        Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
        License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
        termination of this License shall survive.
        8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
        (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
        action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
        (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
        any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
        Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
        Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
        notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
        agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made
        by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
        Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a
        reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
        writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
        granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
        terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
        (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
        Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
        rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
        revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or
        had made, Modifications made by that Participant.
        8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
        that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
        any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
        prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
        value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
        shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
        or license.
        8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end
        user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
        validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
        survive termination.
      9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
      WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
      INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR
      ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
      MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
      PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
      SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
      INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
      APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
        The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
        2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
        ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
        C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
        227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
        acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
      11. MISCELLANEOUS.
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
        hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
        provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
        enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
        (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
        its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
        party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
        the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
        subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
        California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
        party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
        excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
        shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
      12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
        for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
        of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
        Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
      13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
        Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
        Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensedmeans that the Initial Developer permits
        you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the
        alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
        described in Exhibit A.

      translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
      generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
      available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
      in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
      based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
      original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
      shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
      name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
      of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
      thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by

      behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
      Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on

      and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
      or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
      Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
      whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
      within the Work.
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
      form.
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
      license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
      transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
      licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
      which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
      You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed.
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
      Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
          this License; and
        b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and
        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
          distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
          any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
          attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
          one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
          the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
          along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
          not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
          Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
          NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
          cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.

      ==================================
      Creative Commons Legal Code
      ---------------------------
      CC0 1.0 Universal
      -----------------
      CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
      SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
      RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
      CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
      INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
      RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
      HEREUNDER.
      Statement of Purpose
      The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
      exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
      subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
      and/or a database (each, a "Work").
      Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
      purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
      ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
      infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
      redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
      including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
      the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
      creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
      distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
      For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
      additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
      (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
      Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
      publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
      Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
      effect of CC0 on those rights.
      1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
      by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
      Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
        i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
          and translate a Work;
        ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
          depicted in a Work;
        iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
          to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
        v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
          Work;
        vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
          European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
          protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
          including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
          based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
      2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
      applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
      unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
      Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
      unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
      the Work
        i.  in all territories worldwide,
        ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
          future time extensions),
        iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and
        iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").
      Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
      and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
      such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
      termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
      enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
      Statement of Purpose.
      3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
      judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall
      be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
      express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
      Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
      non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
      exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
        i.  in all territories worldwide,
        ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
          future time extensions),
        iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and
        iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").
      The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer
      to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
      invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
      ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
      case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not
        i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
          Work or
        ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
          Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
      4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
        a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
          surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
        b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
          any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
          including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
          for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
          defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
          discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
        c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
          may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
          person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
          disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
          other rights required for any use of the Work.
        d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
          to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
          use of the Work.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
      translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
      generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
      available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
      in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
      based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
      annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
      original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
      shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
      name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
      of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works
      thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
      the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
      behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
      Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on
      electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
      that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
      and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
      or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
      Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of
      whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
      within the Work.
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
      form.
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
      license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
      transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
      licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
      which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
      against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
      You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
      litigation is filed.
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
      Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
          this License; and
        b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and
        c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
          distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
          the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
          any part of the Derivative Works; and
        d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
          any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
          attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
          one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
          the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
          along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
          Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
          The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
          not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
          Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
          NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
          cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
      additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
      provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with the conditions stated in this License.
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
      Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
      Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
      additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
      supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
      executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
      for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
      reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
      writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
      Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
      either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
      tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
      applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
      writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
      arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
      computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
      losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
      acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
      rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
      may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
      any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
      Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
      liability.
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
