    title="Tell us a little more about yourself, your role at Porsche and what topics drive you.">

    I’m passionate about innovative technologies and creating seamless user
    experiences. I’m particularly interested in areas like cloud architecture,
    system scalability, and building efficient microservices and micro frontends.
    Open source has always resonated with me, and my first significant public
    contribution was in the field of an observability tool.

    title="Can you please explain what a Technology Radar is in a nutshell and what benefits it offers?">

    In simple terms, a Technology Radar is a tool that provides transparency on the
    technologies, frameworks, and methodologies used by different teams within an
    organization. It helps in achieving alignment among the teams by giving an
    overview of the technologies in use, thus ensuring that everyone is on the same
    page and promoting efficiency. While it doesn't force any team to adopt specific
    technologies, it allows for a collaborative review of what is being utilized and
    the benefits it brings, fostering a culture of sharing and learning from each
    other’s experiences.
    <br/>
    Think of the Technology Radar as a compass that guides us through the ever-growing complexity of IT software development.
    This tool offers numerous benefits for our engineers and IT architects at Porsche Digital:
    - It fosters a culture where teams are encouraged to experiment with new technologies and methods.
      By sharing the knowledge gained internally, our teams can learn from each other's experiences,
      helping us stay competitive in the fast-changing IT landscape.
    - It reduces technical debt and friction between teams by streamlining the technologies we use. 
    This is essential for enhancing efficiency and boosting collaboration across different teams.
    
    While the Technology Radar is just a tool, its true value lies in the discussions it sparks among different ARTs and teams. By jointly assessing technologies, we create a shared understanding of the direction we want to evolve in.

    title="You decided to fork the open source Technology Radar project from AOE. What were your reasons for selecting this project over other solutions?">

    Before I joined Porsche Digital in April this year, there were already some Technology
    Radar initiatives in place, primarily using collaborative whiteboards. These
    boards offered insights into the technologies teams were using, but they had
    limitations. Each team had its perspective, which sometimes resulted in
    conflicting categorizations of technologies. This lack of a unified view drove
    us to look for a better solution.

    While searching for an effective tool, I stumbled upon [AOE’s Technology Radar](https://www.aoe.com/techradar/),
    which they use to display their technologies. This tool was interactive, detailed, and
    not overwhelming, hitting the perfect balance we were looking for. AOE had also
    made this Technology Radar [available as an open-source framework](https://github.com/AOEpeople/aoe_technology_radar), which was a perfect
    fit for our needs.

    title="Over time, more teams began to adapt this project. Could you share more details about this project?">

    Initially, the idea was to deploy the Technology Radar just for my Agile Release
    Train (ART). However, after discussing with another architect, who had already faced
    challenges with their existing system managed through Excel files, it became
    clear that there was potential to scale this across other departments. We
    collaborated closely to refine and deploy the Technology Radar, making it adaptable
    for broader use within Porsche Digital.

    Our collaboration led to setting up the Technology Radar in a manner that could be
    easily expanded and adapted by other teams. We started by deploying our instance
    and then created a public fork of the project, while also contributing back to
    the upstream project. This not only helped our internal teams but also
    supported the public open-source community.

    title="What did you learn along the way? What were the benefits of this strategy for you, your team and Porsche Digital?">

    One of the key learnings from this project is the incredible spirit of
    collaboration and innovation within Porsche Digital. There was a strong drive to
    find solutions that benefit everyone. The enthusiasm and support from colleagues
    were instrumental in pushing this project forward.

    We now have multiple instances of the Technology Raider running, with at least three
    or four different departments adopting it. This tool has become a powerful asset
    for us to keep track of technological developments, promote inner-source
    initiatives, and contribute back to the open-source community.

    title="Can you give us more insight about the additional features that are provided in the fork?">

    Sure! In [our fork](https://github.com/porscheofficial/porschedigital-technology-radar), we have integrated additional features that are specifically tailored to meet our needs at Porsche Digital. We're happy to contribute our modifications back to the upstream project whenever the community shows interest.
    - For example, we now have the ability to map blips to specific teams, which is important because we have many different teams within our ARTs. This mapping creates an extra layer that encourages teams to work together on common technology.
    - On the overview page of our Technology Radar, users can now see all of our teams and filter the information based on a specific team. This functionality helps to quickly understand the tech stack, tools, and methodologies that each team is using.
    - We've added a development mode that allows changes to the Markdown files to be reflected immediately without having to restart the entire build process.
    - We also implemented a single sign-on (SSO) integration based on EntraID, which simplifies both authentication and authorization for our users. We released this as a plug-and-play solution in a separate open-source repository: [@porscheofficial/vercel-static-extensions](https://github.com/porscheofficial/vercel-static-extensions)

    title="With a glimpse into the future: What are your plans regarding FOSS Contributions?">

    As more departments adopt our Technology Radar, we hope to see increased contributions
    and improvements to the upstream project. This shared framework not only
    enhances our internal alignment but also prepares us to contribute more
    effectively to the open-source community.

    The journey of the Technology Radar from an idea to a internally maintained tool
    within Porsche Digital is a testament to the power of open-source and
    inner-source collaboration. We look forward to continued growth and
    contributions to this project.
