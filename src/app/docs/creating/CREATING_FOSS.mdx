## How we manage new open-source projects

<InlineNotification theme="dark" dismissButton={false}>
  The purpose of this document is to provide transparency on how Porsche is
  managing new open-source projects and the standards we're endorsing to foster
  healthy communities. The intended audience is both interested visitors as well
  as employees of Porsche AG and subsidiaries.
</InlineNotification>

### Preliminary steps

We support and encourage our employees to launch and maintain new FOSS projects.
Our employees can find more information on our contribution policy in our
<LinkPure theme="dark" icon="lock" underline="true"
href="https://skyway.porsche.com/confluence/display/OSO/Contribution+Guide">corporate wiki.</LinkPure>

### Our GitHub flow

We consider the default branch of our projects as stable/working and protect this
with a minimal set of the following branch protection rules:

```markdown
- Require a pull request before merging
  - Require 1 approval
- Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Do not allow bypassing the above settings
```

More information on our GitHub flow can be found in the [Porsche Development
Guidance.](https://devguidance.porsche.com/coding/vcs/git-branching-model/#nowadays-widely-adopted-github-flow)

<InlineNotification theme="dark" dismissButton={false}>
To contribute to an open-source project maintained by Porsche, please fork the
repository, commit your changes to a separate branch and get them merged into
the default branch via a reviewed pull request. More information on how to
contribute to our projects can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file of the
particular project.
</InlineNotification>

### Necessary files and documents

The following files and documents are generally included in all our open-source projects: 

1. A pull request template <Tag theme="dark">.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md</Tag>:

   ```markdown
   ### Pull Request Checklist

   <!-- Make sure to read and accept the CLA, before you open the pull request! -->
   <!-- Tick the checkbox below if you accept our CLA (`[x]`) -->

   - [ ] I have read and accept the [Contributor License Agreement](https://opensource.porsche.com/docs/cla)
   ```

   Further requirements may be included in our pull request templates, but the
   checkbox "**I have read and accept the Contributor License Agreement**" is
   always required.

2. The unmodified license text of the FOSS project in a file named <Tag
   theme="dark">LICENSE.md</Tag>.

3. A <Tag theme="dark">README.md</Tag> that introduces and explains the FOSS
   project. We're following the [makeareadme.com](https://makeareadme.com/)
   template for writing good READMEs.

4. A file <Tag theme="dark">CONTRIBUTING.md</Tag> that explains how to contribute to
   the FOSS project. 

5. If third-party components are distributed as a bundled
   release, a compulsory Open Source Software Notice in a file named
   <Tag theme="dark">NOTICE.txt</Tag>.

### Fostering a welcoming community

Contributions to our open-source projects, may it be reporting issues or
contributing changes, are highly appreciated! To foster a welcoming
community, we encourage our maintainers to

- triage new issues created by you in a timely manner, and
- address pull requests in a timely manner. If a pull request needs change or a
  pipeline fails, we make sure to indicate a hint on how to resolve them.

### Release Management

By incorporating a minimal release management, we give others the chance to rely
on our Porsche FOSS projects. This includes

- tagging the main branch and releasing whenever reasonable,
- adopting a suitable versioning scheme, e.g. [Semantic
  Versioning,](https://semver.org/)
- indicating breaking changes, and
- publishing release notes that reflect all changes, offering a hint on
  upgradability and giving credit to all contributors.
