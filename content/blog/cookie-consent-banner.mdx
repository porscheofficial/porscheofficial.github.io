descriptionShort: The Cookie Consent Banner is one of the very first FOSS projects published by Porsche back in 2021. In this Contributor Story, the two maintainers Tim and Patrick share what they have learnt over the past three years and how they managed to keep an eye on the needs of the community.

    title="Tell us a little more about yourself, your role at Porsche and what topics drive you.">

    **Tim (Web Developer Customer Innovation / Physical Products):** I'm passionate
    about enabling best-in-class user experiences for our products. To achieve
    this, we all rely on software packages that must meet high quality
    standards. It is therefore particularly important to me to be an active
    member of the open-source world and to contribute our ambitious standards
    back to the community.
    <br/>
    **Patrick (System Architect My Porsche):** I'm a huge fan of a great user
    experience. Not only for the end users of a product, but also for the software
    engineers creating these. An awesome developer experience leads to an awesome
    (end-) user experience. That's why I enjoy spending time into defining a
    meaningful and scalable interface definition. The Cookie Consent Banner is such
    an example. It's a component that you have to build for legal reasons and
    probably doesn't change quite often after the initial implementation. It shouldn't
    be complicated when you need to adapt it again after some time. The Cookie Consent
    Banner is very flexible, yet still convenient to integrate.

    title="You are currently maintaining Porsche's open-source project Cookie Consent Banner on GitHub. How would you explain your project in a nutshell? What problem does your project solve for Porsche?">

    **Patrick:** I'm sure everybody remembers the time when cookie banners first appeared on the
    internet. It's not only cumbersome for the visitors of a website but also for
    the maintainers to implement such a solution. So we created a component that is not
    only informative to the visitors of a website, but also easy to integrate for
    the product teams. It should be as straightforward as possible to integrate
    third-party scripts and cookies into a website in a privacy-friendly manner,
    always respecting the decision of the visitor. That's why the component doesn't
    do any magical gatekeeping of such scripts, but instead making it very
    convenient for the developer to get to know the information about the consent of
    the visitor. The developers should have total control over what's happening on the
    website and which scripts are being loaded.  
    <br/>
    **Tim:** In innovation projects, we work in a particularly agile manner and in
    short development cycles. A cookie banner was therefore the perfect opportunity
    to give something back to the community and at the same time create a building
    block that enables innovation projects to build GDPR-compliant pages with
    minimal effort.

    title="With over 3000 weekly downloads your project already gained some adoption among the community. What did you learn along the way of maintaining an open-source project?">

    **Patrick:** The component should be easy to use, thus we need to ensure a
    balance between sensible defaults and a potentially overwhelming set of
    options to customize. Given the success of the component, I would say we
    found a good balance. I really like the feedback the community provides via
    GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. For example, one of the issues we had
    was someone mentioning how the component was affecting their Google Lighthouse score.
    Together, we found a solution, making the component performing better for
    everybody. And while feature requests are always welcome, I'm hopeful to see
    more direct contributions through Pull Requests in the future. It's this
    kind of active collaboration that brings out the best in open-source
    projects.
    <br/>
    **Tim:** Apart from the question of finding the right level of customization
    options, the biggest challenge for me in this project is the variety of
    different contexts in which the component is used: There is a very wide range of
    different browsers we need to support but also, we decided to make the component
    available as a React component. This is only possible using extensive testing in
    different environments and with the help of standards such as the Web Component
    standard and tools like Stencil. This illustrates the importance of these
    projects in the overall FOSS context, as we rely on open source to build open
    source.

    title="It's great to see how the Cookie Consent Banner was able to attract a decent community around the project. Are there specific reasons why you decided to publish this component under a FOSS license?">

    Contributing is never a zero-sum game. The return is always greater than the
    resources invested. People often only see that it requires additional effort to
    create a software component in a way that makes it also usable for other
    products as well. That is only half the truth. If multiple teams develop the
    same software component, the whole company invests twice the required resources.
    Additionally, an active open-source community provides a huge amount of
    knowledge that is hard to replicate within a closed environment. For instance, a
    developer reported an issue with the Cookie Consent Banner for a specific
    browser version. We only learned about that because of the community. And yes,
    there's always the argument that publishing something as open source will also
    help competitors. Well, that's true, but let's be honest, a great cookie consent
    banner will not make a dramatic difference. It's a base component that every
    product needs to provide. I'm not asking to share software components that could
    be described as the “secret sauce”.
