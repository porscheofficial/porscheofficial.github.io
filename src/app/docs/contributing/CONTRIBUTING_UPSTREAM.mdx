### Be an outstanding open-source citizen

As Porsche Group, we do not only want to be a good open-source citizen by being
compliant when consuming open-source software, but be an outstanding open-source
citizen by contributing back to the community and collaborating with
professionals worldwide. Thus, please ensure to

- act responsible,
- help others wherever possible by sharing your knowledge,
- learn from others and accept different standpoints or requirements,
- give credit where credit's due, especially when collaborating with others.

### Establish a 4-eyes-principle

If your proposed change is not trivial (e.g. fixing typos), please ensure that a
colleague is able to

- reproduce and confirm your issue or
- review your change request and successfully build/execute the changed code.
