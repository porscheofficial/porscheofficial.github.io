## Creating a FOSS project on behalf of Porsche

<InlineNotification theme="dark" dismissButton={false}>
  The purpose of this document is to provide transparency on how Porsche is
  managing new open-source projects and the standards we're internally endorsing
  to foster healthy communities. The intended audience is both interested
  visitors as well as employees of Porsche AG and subsidiaries.

### Preliminary steps

You can always start developing or preparing the go-live of your FOSS project in
a private repository, e.g. on [GitHub](https://github.com/porscheofficial)
or on your corporate GitLab instance.

Before publishing your project under an open source license, please make sure to
follow our process for FOSS Contributions. You can find more information in our

>corporate wiki.</LinkPure>

### Establish a 4-eyes-principle

If not agreed other with Open Source Office of Porsche AG (OSO), your project
will typically be hosted on GitHub - Porsche Open Source Platform. The default
branch (i.e. main) of your repository should always be considered as
stable/working and be protected with a minimal set of branch protection rules:

```markdown
- Require a pull request before merging
  - Require 1 approval
- Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Do not allow bypassing the above settings
```

More information on our GitHub flow can be found in the [Porsche Development
Guidance.](https://devguidance.porsche.com/coding/vcs/git-branching-model/#nowadays-widely-adopted-github-flow)

### Necessary files and documents

Please make sure that the following files are included in the FOSS project you're maintaining:

1. Please add the following pull request template in a file named <Tag
   theme="dark">.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md</Tag> to your repository:

   ```markdown
   ### Pull Request Checklist

   <!-- Make sure to read and accept the CLA, before you open the pull request! -->
   <!-- Tick the checkbox below if you accept our CLA (`[x]`) -->

   - [ ] I have read and accept the [Contributor License Agreement](https://opensource.porsche.com/docs/cla)
   ```

   You're free to add further content to the pull request template, but make
   sure that the checkbox "**I have read and accept the Contributor License
   Agreement**" is always included.

2. Please add the unmodified license text of your FOSS project in a file named
   <Tag theme="dark">LICENSE.md</Tag> to your repository. We're happy to help
   you finding a suitable license for your FOSS Project. Don't grant a license
   without first consulting the OSO!

3. Please add a file <Tag theme="dark">README.md</Tag> to your repository that
   introduces and explains your FOSS project. See for instance
   [makeareadme.com](https://makeareadme.com/) as a helpful starting point for
   writing good READMEs.

4. Please add a file <Tag theme="dark">CONTRIBUTING.md</Tag> to your repository
   that explains how to contribute to your FOSS project. Check out our existing
   contributing guides, e.g.
   [cookie-consent-banner/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/porscheofficial/cookie-consent-banner/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   as an inspiration.

5. If you distribute third-party components by packaging them into a bundled
   release, please add the compulsory Open Source Software Notice (that is provided
   to you by OSO during FOSS Compliance process) in a file named
   <Tag theme="dark">NOTICE.txt</Tag>.

### Own your project

As maintainer of a Porsche FOSS project, you should always keep in mind that you
own a project that is directly connected to the Porsche brand. Thus, make sure
to adopt the following standards:

- Always triage new issues in a timely manner. Don't let adopters wait until
  they receive their first answer.
- Make sure to address pull requests in a timely manner. If a pull request needs
  change or a pipeline fails, please make sure to indicate reasonable hints on
  how to resolve them.

### Release Management

By incorporating a minimal release management, we give others the chance to rely
on our Posche FOSS projects. This includes

- tagging your main branch and releasing whenever reasonable,
- adopting a suitable versioning scheme, e.g. [Semantic
  Versioning,](https://semver.org/)
- indicating breaking changes, and
- publishing release notes that reflect all changes, offers a hint on
  upgradability and gives credit to all contributors.
