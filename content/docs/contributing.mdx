## How we contribute to open-source projects

<PInlineNotification theme="dark" dismissButton={false}>
  The purpose of this document is to provide transparency on how Porsche is
  contributing to open-source projects and the standards we're endorsing. The
  intended audience is both interested visitors as well as employees of Porsche
  AG and subsidiaries.
</PInlineNotification>

### Preliminary steps

Following our [FOSS Movement](/#foss-movement), we empower our employees to
dedicate time for participating in FOSS activities. FOSS activities are not only
limited to contributing code but should also embrace non-code contributions such
as design, translations, bug reporting, UX Improvement, recruiting, testing,
documentation, project and community management, communication and many more.
Our employees are provided with all means and information on our contribution
policy in our <PLinkPure theme="dark" icon="lock" underline="true"
href="https://skyway.porsche.com/confluence/display/OSO/Contribution+Guide">
corporate wiki.</PLinkPure>

Furthermore, we appreciate any contribution to the FOSS projects we're maintaining.
You can find more information on the agreement under which you can contribute to
our FOSS projects in our [Contributor License Agreement](/docs/cla).

### Our pledge

As Porsche Group, we do not only want to be a good open-source citizen by being
compliant when using open-source software, but be an outstanding open-source
citizen by contributing back to the community and collaborating with
professionals worldwide. Thus, we ensure to

- act responsible,
- help others wherever possible by sharing your knowledge,
- learn from others and accept different standpoints or requirements,
- give credit where credit's due, especially when collaborating with others.

### Establishing a 4-eyes-principle

Generally, we ensure that a second peer is able to

- reproduce and confirm the issue or
- review the proposed change and successfully build/execute it.

More information on our coding principles can be found in the [Porsche Development
Guidance.](https://devguidance.porsche.com/coding/core-principles/language/)

### Git Configuration

We will contribute to outbound FOSS projects by signing all our commits with an
official Porsche email address and on behalf of
[@porscheofficial](https://github.com/porscheofficial), including the following block
at the end of our commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@porsche.de>
on-behalf-of: @porscheofficial <open_source_office@porsche.de>
```

Thus, should you contribute on behalf of Porsche, please ensure that
- you and your supervisor have the required signature authorization,
- you received final approval from the Open Source Office at Porsche AG to contribute,
- you have added an official Porsche email address to your GitHub account,
- you sign all commits with your official Porsche email address as stated above.

See [Setting your commit email
address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)
and [Creating a commit on behalf of an
organization](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-on-behalf-of-an-organization)
for more information.
