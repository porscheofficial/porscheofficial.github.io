Dispositions générales sur les logiciels libres et offre écrite

====================================================================

Les termes et les conditions des licences énumérées ci-dessous constituent
la base contractuelle de votre utilisation des composants logiciels
correspondants et remplacent tout autre accord contractuel concernant ce
produit, cette solution ou ce service Porsche (« produit »).

Les modifications du logiciel propriétaire dans votre produit pour votre
propre usage et l'ingénierie inverse pour le débogage de ces modifications
sont autorisées par la présente dans la mesure où ces composants logiciels
sont liés à des bibliothèques de programmes sous  la Licence Générale
Publique Limitée GNU (GNU Lesser General Public License, LGPL). Néanmoins,
vous ne devez pas divulguer à des tiers les connaissances acquises lors de
l'ingénierie inverse ou du débogage, ni les informations obtenues lors de
l’ingénierie inverse, ni le logiciel modifié lui-même. Veuillez prendre en
considération que toute modification se fait à vos risques et périls et
qu'elle entraîne une exclusion de garantie pour les défauts résultant de la
modification. En outre, le produit peut ne pas être utilisable pour l'usage
auquel il est destiné. Cette disposition prévaut sur toute autre
disposition contractuelle entre vous et Porsche ou votre concessionnaire
Porsche.

Pour plus d’informations sur les composants logiciels énumérés ci-dessous
ainsi que les conditions de licence correspondantes et - dans la mesure où
la licence l'exige - les codes sources, veuillez contacter Porsche à
l'adresse www.porsche.com/softwareinfo.

Toutefois, certaines licences exigent la fourniture de copies physiques du
code source et/ou du code objet. Dans un tel cas, vous et tout tiers pouvez
obtenir une copie des codes source et/ou objet conformément aux exigences
de la licence de logiciel libre applicable en nous contactant à l'adresse
www.porsche.com/softwareinfo. En outre, veuillez nous contacter à l'URL
précitée dans le cas où vous auriez besoin de toute autre assistance
concernant l'exercice des droits garantis accordés par une licence de
logiciel libre. Une redevance nominale (c'est-à-dire le coût de l'exécution
physique de la distribution) pourrait être facturée pour ces services.

À la demande des auteurs et des détenteurs de droits des logiciels libres
utilisés dans ce produit, nous vous informons de ce qui suit :

« LES LOGICIELS LIBRES DE CE PRODUIT SONT DISTRIBUÉS DANS L'ESPOIR QU'ILS
SERONT UTILES, MAIS SANS AUCUNE GARANTIE, MÊME PAS LA GARANTIE IMPLICITE DE
QUALITÉ MARCHANDE OU D'ADÉQUATION À UN USAGE PARTICULIER. Pour plus de
détails, veuillez consulter les licences applicables. »

Note : votre copie de ce produit peut ne pas contenir de code couvert par
une ou plusieurs des licences énumérées ici, selon le produit et la version
exacts que vous choisissez.

General Open Source Provisions and written offer

====================================================================

The license terms listed below form the contractual basis for your use of
the corresponding software components and supersede any other contractual
agreements concerning this Porsche product, solution or service
(“product”).

Modifications of the proprietary software within your product for your own
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications are herewith
permitted to the extent such software components are linked to program
libraries under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). However, you
must not disclose the knowledge acquired during reverse engineering or
debugging, nor the information obtained from the reengineering, nor the
modified software itself to any third party. Please note that any
modification is at your own risk and will void any warranty for defects
resulting from the modification. In addition, the product may not be usable
for its intended purpose. This provision takes precedence over any other
contractual provision between you and Porsche or your Porsche Dealer.

For further information regarding the software components listed below and
the corresponding license terms and – where required by license – source
codes, please contact Porsche at www.porsche.com/softwareinfo.

Some licenses, however, require the provision of physical copies of source
and/or object code. In this case, you and any third party may obtain a copy
of the source and/or object codes according to the requirements of the
applicable Open Source License by contacting us at
www.porsche.com/softwareinfo. Furthermore, please contact us at the
foregoing URL in case you need assistance regarding the exercise of rights
guaranteed by an Open Source License. A nominal fee (i.e., the cost of
physically performing the distribution) might be charged for these
services.

On request of the authors and right holders of the Open Source Software
used in this product we inform you about the following:

“THE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IN THIS PRODUCT IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE HOPE THAT
IT WILL BE USEFUL, BUT WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, WITHOUT EVEN THE IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
applicable licenses for more details.”

Note: your copy of this product may not contain code covered by one or more
of the licenses listed here, depending on the exact product and version you
choose.

 lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
 constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
 licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
 the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
 Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
 Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
 of this License; and

 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
 You changed the files; and

 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
 distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
 Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
 part of the Derivative Works; and

 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
 any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
 attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
 that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
 following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
 Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
 with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
 Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
 License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
 You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
 provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
 modifying the License.

 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
 additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
 distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
 whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
 complies with the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
 Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
 Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
 additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
 supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
 executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
 trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
 for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
 reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
 writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
 Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
 KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
 or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
 associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
 tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
 applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
 writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
 direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
 character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to
 use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
 stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
 damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
 possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
 Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
 acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
 and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
 obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
 responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
 to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
 accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
