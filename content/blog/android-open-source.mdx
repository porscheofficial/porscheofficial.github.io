    I am a solution architect with a solid background in software engineering. From
    2021, I am part of the Android Automotive development team at Porsche. I am
    passionate about breaking new ground, building vibrant, user-centric features,
    and increasing the overall driver experience.

    Android is an operating system that is collectively maintained by a global
    community of individuals and companies. What started a decade ago as a technical
    foundation for nowadays around 70% of all smartphones, has quickly evolved to a
    Swiss army knife that powers watches, televisions, and car infotainment systems.

    Porsche is integrating Android Automotive OS (AAOS) with the help of our Tier 2
    and Tier 1 suppliers into our future infotainment control units. By building upon a
    well-proven and established open platform, we have significantly reduced the pain of
    having to integrate proprietary solutions being sold as a black box to Porsche.
    The freedom to analyze and modify the source code allows us to confirm issues and
    request changes that meet our requirements at Porsche. It is also worth noting,
    that the prospering ecosystem around the Android open-source project offers us the
    ability to easily find new talents and seek help from a global community of
    technology leaders.

    title="By contributing to AOSP, you have made a big step ahead in our FOSS movement. What was your initial motivation to take this path? Can you tell us why you have chosen to collaborate with an open-source community?">
    All officially approved Android products, e.g., our car infotainment system,
    must adhere to the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD). To
    automatically test devices for compliance, the community has developed a
    Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) that executes various test cases directly on the
    device. My team diligently works together with our suppliers to make sure that
    all tests are completed successfully. During our joint work, we encountered
    several unit tests that have failed due to a bug within the test itself. By
    reporting the bugs directly to the community, not only do we benefit from future
    fixes, but so do all our partners, such as Audi, whose Android team is currently
    doing the same integration work. Breaking new ground, creating synergies between
    teams, and fostering collaboration is right up my ally!

    title="What did you learn along the way? What were the benefits of this strategy for you, your team and Porsche?">
    As great as open-source projects are, there are unfortunately every now and then
    features that do not work as expected, e.g., parts of the Android Compatibility
    Test Suite. On the other hand, the four freedoms of FOSS allow us to act, change
    the code and propose changes to the community.

    Together with Legal and the Open Source Office, we have taken all necessary
    steps that enable us to report the above-mentioned bugs to Google. All teams
    involved were highly dedicated to supporting us and made it possible not only
    for us to contribute to the Android project, but in the future all other teams
    at Porsche who want to contribute to Google Open Source projects.

    It is thrilling to see how a global community can use their collective
    brainpower to continuously improve a product such as Android and I am happy that
    we have joined this journey.

    title="With a glimpse into the future: What are your further plans for FOSS Contributions? Who would you like to see next joining our FOSS Contributor community?">
    Only reporting bugs is not where we should stop at. Porsche has all means
    regarding knowledge and capabilities to also propose changes to the Android
    community. By moving towards a stronger focus on in-house development, we can
    build the necessary skills to lead by example in this important project and
    collaborate with technology leaders at eye level.
